Better Contact Form
=================
![A better contact form experience](/screenshot.png)


This is more of an **idea for UX improvement** rather than a complete solution<sup>1</sup>. My proposal is to: 

1. allow your visitors to include **any form of contact** on your contact form (eg: phone number or Twitter handle instead of an email)

2. include **an option to use user's email client** if he or she really doesn't like contact forms

3. if your visitor uses an email in the form, **send him or her a confirmation email**

To try the form, download the code from this repository and change the _mail.php_, specifically these two parts: 

	$recipient = "your@email.com";
	...
	<a href=\"http://YOURSITE.COM\">

Also, in _index.html_:

	<a id="contactmelink" onclick="javascript:sendEmail();" href="mailto:your@email.com">Send me an email</a>


I am including **two versions** of the form, a simple one (which has one small issue<sup>2</sup>) and a fancier one that uses Twitter Bootstrap (Apache License: https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/master/LICENSE).

***
<sup>1</sup> The mail script will try to prevent email injection by removing certain characters that allow adding CC and BCC email addresses and stripping HTML tags. For more details see

	function str_sanitize($str, $allow_nl)

in _mail.php_.


Furthermore, I am using **a very simple implementation of the honeypot technique** to prevent spam. You can read more about this method here: http://nedbatchelder.com/text/stopbots.html (or just google it). In a nutshell: you are creating a **hidden input field**, here called _fullname_. The _email.php_ script will check if the field was filled out (bots don't process CSS, so to them it will be visible).

One drawback of this technique is that the hidden field is visible to people using screen readers (or certain browsers), to which one simple solution is to use something like _"Ignore this field, thank you"_ for a title.

Again, this is **not a complete solution**, so please feel free to implement your own security method(s) here.

<sup>2</sup> I seem to have a problem in Chrome when using Gmail as my default email client. Attempting to show the form automatically opens a new email in Gmail. The only solution I came up with is to remove the no-javascript fallback, that is in index.html I would change this:

	<a id="contactmelink" onclick="javascript:sendEmail();" href="mailto:your@email.com">Send me an email</a>

To this:

	<a id="contactmelink" onclick="javascript:sendEmail(); return false;" href="#">Send me an email</a>

On Linux, I have the problem even when using Firefox (In Windows it's limited only to Chrome, Firefox works fine).

The "fancy" version doesn't have this problem at all.

Assorted Feedback and Suggestions
=================================
  
>Your multi-source contact info field cannot possibly reliably detect whether the user is entering a twitter, email, website, or other contact information. Not even with matching against strings/regex. You're gonna run into people putting unverifiable junk in that box, and people who don't specify what source the contact is from. The traditional way is to send an email to the address to see if it works. 

The use cases of this form don't require this. This form suits best personal websites where the visitor trying to get in touch with you is very likely to want to include proper contact information.

> You should look into APIs like http://www.fullcontact.com/developer that can find all of a user's social accounts just given his email.

> If you wanna see some "advanced" forms, check out http://wufoo.com 

The contact forms I made are just examples/blueprints, so I am intentionally keeping them simple. The real point is to show the UX ideas: the "multi-source contact info field", an option to use user's email client instead of forcing him or her to use the form and sending a confirmation email, if possible.

You can actually use wufoo.com and follow while following these principles.

The actual forms only serve as a "clickable" example, which I think would be better than a mockup screenshot.

A Few Good Tips I Didn't Implement
==================================
  
- The _Name_ field is not really necessary, as it will likely be included in the email or the person's Twitter page. The visitor can also easily include his or her name in the message.
